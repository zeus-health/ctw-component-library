# ctw-component-library

## 0.10.4

### Patch Changes

- fb028c6: Use more codes to filter out duplicate condition records from notReviewed
- 9e5bb33: Continue enforcing the rule of only showing builder-owned records as confirmed, by covering the new edge case where there are shared resources with other builders. Clients will not need to make any changes.

## 0.10.3

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- f3def6c: In the condition table, column widths were recalculated to add up to 100% to avoid confusion. This will not impact how the table is viewed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 53e07aa: In condition tables, the CCS group of a condition is now displayed as a new column beside the name of the condition. Since some condition names are overly detailed, the CCS group can serve as a more readable description. If a condition does not have a CCS code, it will simply be left blank.
